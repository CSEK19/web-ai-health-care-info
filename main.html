                        internet that enables us to build a virtual world using augmented reality, virtual reality,
                        artificial intelligence, and the internet of things. Artificial Intelligence with Machine
                        Learning is the most reviewed and worked on course right now.<br> The most fundamental aspect of
                        solving a problem is to learn.

                    <p>Most of us engage with <ins>artificial intelligence</ins> daily and often do not even realize it. Amazon Alexa, Pandora and Netflix, to name a few, all leverage AI technology to learn more about user profiles and preferences. These
                        AI-based systems then use this knowledge to deliver a more personalized experience based on learned patterns of behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are several industries that benefit from artificial intelligence and are likely to implement it on a larger scale in the future. For example, most of the “Big Four” tax and accounting firms already rely on AI to comb through,
                        classify, arrange, and analyze millions of pages of client documents with higher accuracy rates and much faster processing speed (often on the order of 100x-1000x) than when the same work was done manually.
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides, the complexity and rise of data in healthcare means that artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be applied within the field. Several types of AI are already being employed by payers and providers of care, and life
                        sciences companies. The key categories of applications involve diagnosis and treatment recommendations, patient engagement and adherence, and administrative activities. Although there are many instances in which AI can perform
                        healthcare tasks as well or better than humans, implementation factors will prevent large-scale automation of healthcare professional jobs for a considerable period.

                <p>AI could soon play an important role in the self-management of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and depression. Self-management can be assisted by AI solutions, including <i>conversational agents, health monitoring and risk prediction tools, personalized
                        adaptive interventions, and technologies</i>to address the needs of individuals with disabilities.</p>

                        <li style="font-family: 'Fira Sans', sans-serif;"><i>Conversational agents</i> can engage in two-way dialogue with the user via speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding, and natural language generation (Laranjo et al., 2018). AI is
                            behind many of them. These interfaces may include text-based dialogue, spoken language, or both. They are called, variously, virtual agents, chatbots, or chatterbots. Some conversational agents present a human image (e.g.,
                            the image of a nurse or a coach) or nonhuman image (e.g., a robot or an animal) to provide a richer interactive experience. Most adults say they would use an intelligent virtual coach or an intelligent virtual nurse to monitor
                            health and symptoms at home.

                                tools</i>: AI can use raw data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, microphones, cameras, and other sensors, including smartphones. Machine-learning algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns from the raw data inputs and
                            then categorize these patterns as indicators of an individual’s behaviour and health status. These systems can allow patients to understand and manage their own health and symptoms as well as share data with medical providers.

                        <li style="font-family: 'Fira Sans', sans-serif;"><i>Smart home monitoring and robotics</i>may eventually use AI to address these challenges (Rabbitt et al., 2015). Home monitoring has the potential to increase independence and improve aging at home by monitoring physical space,
                            falls, and amount of time in bed. Currently available social robots such as PARO, Kabochan, and PePeRe provide companionship and stimulation for dementia patients. Recently, the use of robotic pets has been reported to be helpful
                            in reducing agitation in nursing home patients with dementia. For example, PARO is a robot designed to look like a cute, white baby seal that helps calm patients in hospitals and nursing homes.

                        <li style="font-family: 'Fira Sans', sans-serif;"><i>Timely personalized interventions</i>: These are learning systems that deliver dynamic, personalized treatment to users over time. The JITAI makes decisions about when and how to intervene based on response to prior intervention,
                            as well as on awareness of current context, whether internal (mood, anxiety, blood pressure), or external (e.g., location, activity). JITAI assistance is provided when users are most in need of it or will be most receptive
                            to it. These systems can also tell a clinician when a problematic pattern is detected. These interventions rely on sensors, rather than a user’s self-report, to detect states of vulnerability or intervention opportunity.

Over time, human clinicians may move toward tasks and job designs
                            that draw on uniquely human skills like empathy, persuasion and big-picture integration. Perhaps the only healthcare providers who will lose their jobs over time may be those who refuse to work alongside artificial intelligence.

On recognition
                            of an abnormal pattern change, the monitoring system can automatically notify the provider of the patient and instruct the patient to schedule an appointment. Furthermore, based on the information provided by the wearable monitoring
                            system as well as the electronic medical record, a treatment-planning system may use a combination of NLP and ML to recommend adjustments to the current treatment plan to address the specific clinical situation of the patient.
                            Registration and check-in kiosks with NLP and ML can save patients time, reduce resource costs at the front desk and increase the accuracy of information for the provider office and insurers.
